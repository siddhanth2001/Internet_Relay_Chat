## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) project aims to provide a platform for multi-client communication, enabling users to create, join, and interact within virtual chat rooms. Additionally, users have the ability to engage in private messaging with other clients. This README provides an overview of the project's features, specifications, infrastructure, and future considerations.

### Server and Client
The IRC application is powered by both server and client components. The server serves as the backbone, facilitating communication between multiple clients. Clients connect to the server using unique names and can perform various actions such as creating/joining rooms, listing available rooms, exiting rooms, and sending messages.

### Features
- Multi-client communication through server-mediated chat rooms.
- Creation, joining, and leaving of chat rooms.
- Listing available rooms.
- Sending private messages between clients.
- Handling of server and client crashes gracefully.

## Specifications <a name="specifications"></a>

### Communication
- Rooms and one-on-one chats are primary modes of communication.
- Messages sent by users in a room are distributed to all other members, excluding the sender.

### Room Operations
- Listing available rooms using the `$list` command.
- Creation of a room using the `$join` command.
- Joining a room using the `$join` command.
- Leaving a room using the `$leave` command.
- Listing members of a room.

## Infrastructure <a name="infrastructure"></a>

### Client-Server Interaction
- Clients can connect to a server, each with a unique name.
- Clients can create, join, and leave rooms.
- Clients can list available rooms and members within a room.
- Clients can send messages to rooms and handle disconnections gracefully.

## Conclusion and Future Work <a name="conclusion-and-future-work"></a>

The IRC project demonstrates the implementation of a basic chat system capable of facilitating multi-client communication. Future enhancements may include implementing security features, media sharing options, and improving error handling mechanisms. Additionally, considerations for scalability and performance optimization can further enhance the application's robustness and user experience.
